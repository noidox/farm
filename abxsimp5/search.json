    "text": "4.1 Introduction to Penicillins\nPenicillins are one of the largest and oldest classes of antimicrobial agents. Since the development of the natural penicillins in the 1930s, further penicillin development has been directed by the need to combat increasing antimicrobial resistance. Classes of penicillins with expanded gram-negative spectra overcome the shortfalls of natural penicillins, and they can be grouped fairly easily by spectrum of activity.\nPenicillins have several things in common:\n\nPenicillins have very short half-lives (<2 hours) and must be dosed multiple times per day or by continuous infusion. The half-lives of most penicillins are prolonged in the presence of renal dysfunction.\nLike other beta-lactams, penicillins can cause hypersensitivity reactions. If a patient has a true IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to a penicillin, other penicillins should be avoided, even if they are from different subclasses of penicillins. If the reaction is not severe, cephalosporins or carbapenems may be useful.\nMany penicillins are relatively poorly absorbed, even those available as oral formulations. This can lead to diarrhea when oral therapy is needed. Pay attention to the dosing of oral versus intravenous (IV) penicillins—often, a conversion from IV to oral therapy means there will be a substantial decrease in the amount of active drug in the body. Well-absorbed penicillins such as amoxicillin may have dose-limiting gastrointestinal tolerability issues.\n\nMany penicillins were developed after the natural penicillins became available. Until researchers developed beta-lactamase inhibitors, development primarily focused on either improved activity against staphylococci (MSSA) or gram-negative rods (GNRs) (Figure 4.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Penicillin Drug Development"

    "section": "3.1 Introduction to Beta-Lactams",
    "text": "3.1 Introduction to Beta-Lactams\nBeta-lactams, our largest category of antibiotics, can seem overwhelming. Penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems are all beta-lactams. Monobactams (aztreonam) are structurally similar, but they lack one of the two rings that other beta-lactams have and have little to no cross-allergenicity with other beta-lactams. To make matters more confusing, not all beta-lactams end in -cillin or -penem or start with ceph-.\nWe believe the best approach to keeping beta-lactams straight is to group them into classes and learn the characteristics of each class. If you work in a hospital, you will likely have only one or two drugs of each class to worry about. In the outpatient setting, you will encounter many more of them. Fortunately, all beta-lactams have a few things in common:\n\nAll beta-lactams can cause hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild rashes to drug fever to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) to anaphylaxis. There is cross-reactivity between some agents (e.g., amoxicillin and cephalexin), but it is difficult to predict exactly how often that will occur. Studies on the matter differ greatly in their conclusions, though on the whole cross-reactivity seems to be much lower between different types of beta-lactams than previously thought. It seems that similarities between side chains of beta-lactams are responsible for cross-reactivity and that the likelihood of allergic reactions can be predicted by them, but this has not yet disseminated widely into clinical practice.\nSeizures can result from very high doses of any beta-lactam, and some cause other neurologic effects. Accumulation to toxic levels can occur when the dose of a beta-lactam is not properly adjusted for a patient’s renal function. Did you check your patient’s renal function?\nAll beta-lactams share a mechanism of action—inhibition of transpeptidases (i.e., penicillinbinding proteins) in bacterial cell walls, leading to swelling and lysis, killing the organism. Thus, giving two beta-lactams in combination for the same bacteria is generally not useful, but also not antagonistic. (The penicillin-binding protein doesn’t care which drug binds to it.) There are a few exceptions to this rule, but not many.\nAll beta-lactams can be destroyed by beta-lactamases, enzymes produced by bacteria to destroy beta-lactams. Some beta-lactams such as penicillins are easily destroyed, whereas others such as carbapenems are stable against most beta-lactamases. But nature has shown us that whenever a beta-lactam is developed, a beta-lactamase capable of hydrolyzing it inevitably emerges.\nAll beta-lactams lack activity against atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Add another drug to your regimen if you are concerned about these organisms, as in cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\nAll but one of the currently available beta-lactams lack activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA). Add vancomycin or another agent if this bacterium is suspected (but note that its epidemiology is changing). Among the available beta-lactams, only the cephalosporin ceftaroline has anti-MRSA activity. It is the exception that proves the rule.\n\nOnce you know the similarities among beta-lactams, it is easier to learn the differences among them."

    "text": "2.1 Prophylactic Therapy\nThe use of antimicrobial chemotherapy - that is, the treatment of microorganisms with chemical agents - falls into one of three general categories: prophylaxis, empiric use, and definitive therapy. Prophylaxis refers to antibiotics given to prevent an infection that has not yet developed. Use of prophylactic therapy should be limited to patients at high risk of developing an infection, such as those on immunosuppressive therapy, those with cancer, or patients who are having surgery. These patients have weakened natural defenses that render them susceptible to infection. Because the likelihood of infection by some types of organisms in these patients is high and the consequences of infection are dire, we administer antimicrobial drugs to prevent infections from occurring. However, the world is not sterile, and breakthrough infections do occur among patients receiving prophylaxis. The key to understanding antimicrobial prophylaxis is to remember that patients who receive it do not have an infection, but they are at risk for one. It is also the exception, not the rule - most people do not receive antimicrobial prophylaxis against most infections."

    "section": "2.2 Empiric Therapy",
    "text": "2.2 Empiric Therapy\nEmpiric therapy is given to patients who have a proven or suspected infection, but the responsible organism(s) has or have not yet been identified. It is the type of therapy most often initiated in both outpatient and inpatient settings. After the clinician assesses the likelihood of an infection based on physical exam, laboratory findings, and other signs and symptoms, he or she should generally collect samples for culture and Gram staining. For most types of cultures, the Gram stain is performed relatively quickly. In the Gram stain, details about the site of presumed infection are revealed, such as the presence of organisms and white blood cells (WBCs), morphology of the organisms present (e.g., gram-positive cocci in clusters), and the nature of the sample itself, which in some cases indicates if the sample is adequate. The process of culturing the sample begins around the time that the clinician performs the Gram stain. After a day or so, testing will reveal the identification of the organism, and eventually the organism can be tested for its susceptibility to various antibiotics.\nHowever, this process takes several days, so empiric therapy is generally initiated before the clinician knows the exact identification and susceptibilities of the causative organism. Empiric therapy is our best guess of which antimicrobial agent or agents will be most active against the likely cause of infection. Sometimes we are right, and sometimes we are wrong. The significance of making a correct guess differs depending on the severity of the infection; a wrong choice for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) results in an annoyed patient, whereas the wrong choice for meningitis is fatal. Keep in mind that empiric therapy should not be directed against every known organism in nature - just those that cause the infection in question. In other words, broad-spectrum antibiotics are not a substitute for rational thought!"

    "section": "2.3 Definitive Therapy",
    "text": "2.3 Definitive Therapy\nAfter culture and sensitivity results are known, the definitive therapy phase of treatment can begin. Unlike empiric therapy, with definitive therapy we know on what organisms to base our treatment and which drugs should work against them. At this phase, it is prudent to choose antimicrobial agents that are safe, effective, narrow in spectrum, and cost-effective. This helps us avoid unneeded toxicity, treatment failures, and the possible emergence of antimicrobial resistance; it also helps manage costs. In general, moving from empiric to definitive therapy involves decreasing the spectrum of coverage, because we do not need to target organisms that are not causing infection in our patient. In fact, giving overly broad-spectrum antibiotics can lead to the development of superinfections: infections caused by organisms resistant to the anti-biotics in use that occur during therapy.\nThe clinician who is treating an infected patient should always strive to make the transition to definitive therapy. Although it seems obvious, this frequently does not occur. If the patient improves on the first antibiotic, clinicians may be reluctant to transition to more narrowspectrum therapy. Also, some infections may resolve with empiric therapy before culture results would even be available, as frequently happens with uncomplicated UTIs. In other cases, cultures may not be obtained or may be negative in spite of strong signs that the patient has an infection (e.g., clinical symptoms, fever, increased WBC count). Outpatient clinicians frequently skip the culture collection step, begin empiric therapy, and wait to see what happens. This may be because of time pressures or the perceived cost and inconvenience of obtaining cultures in patients with low-acuity infections. In many situations it is important that clinicians continuously consider the need to transition to definitive therapy. Overly broad-spectrum therapy has consequences, and the next infection is likely to be harder to treat. Excessive empiric antibiotic use is a big part of the reason there is an antimicrobial resistance crisis. Keep in mind the general pathway for the treatment of infectious diseases shown in Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: General Approach to Infectious Diseases"

    "section": "2.5 Case Study",
    "text": "2.5 Case Study\nHere is an example of treating a patient with an infection by the above pathway:\nTR is a 63-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who comes to the hospital complaining of pain, redness, and swelling around a wound on his foot. Close inspection reveals that he has an infected diabetic foot ulcer. He is admitted to the hospital (Day 1). A surgeon performs surgical debridement that evening and sends cultures from the wound during surgery as well as blood cultures. Another clinician initiates empiric therapy with vancomycin and ertapenem.\n\nOn Day 2, Gram stain results from the wound are available. There are many WBCs with many gram-positive cocci in clusters but no gram-negative rods (GNRs), so the clinician discontinues ertapenem. Blood cultures do not grow any organisms.\n\nThe following day (Day 3), culture results from the wound reveal many S aureus. Because vancomycin is usually effective against this organism, its use is continued.\n\nOn Day 4, susceptibility results from the wound culture return. The S aureus is found to be susceptible to methicillin, oxacillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, TMP/SMX, and vancomycin. It is resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and levofloxacin. Because the isolate from TR’s wound is methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA), the clinician discontinues vancomycin and initiates definitive therapy with cefazolin. As TR improves towards discharge, the cefazolin is changed to oral cephalexin.\nNote how in TR’s case we began empiric therapy with a broad-spectrum regimen of vancomycin and ertapenem to cover the gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes that tend to cause diabetic foot infections but narrowed that therapy over time as Gram stain and culture data returned. Eventually we were able to choose a highly effective, narrow-spectrum, inexpensive, and safe choice of definitive therapy that was driven by microbiology results. Both vancomycin and ertapenem were active against TR’s S aureus as well, but both represent less-ideal therapy choices, as ertapenem is broader in spectrum and vancomycin’s anti-MRSA activity is not needed. Note: Ertapenem and cephalexin’s activity against this isolate is inferred from the susceptibility pattern even though susceptibility to these agents was not tested directly."

    "text": "2.6 A Note on Rapid Diagnostics\nNovel ways to determine the identification of microorganisms are making their way into clinical practice. Identification of bacteria rapidly by mass spectroscopy has become common in microbiology laboratories, decreasing time from isolation to identification. Techniques that do not rely on culturing and the inherent delay that it represents are already commonly used to detect and quantify many viruses, such as polymerase chain reactions (PCR). These and other techniques are being used to identify other pathogens as well, such as strains of Candida (to determine likely fluconazole susceptibility), Clostridioides difficile, and even MRSA. As these technologies permeate clinical microbiology labs, hopefully the delays to effective therapy that current gold-standard culture and susceptibility testing cause will vanish."

    "text": "Despite the promises of the household-products industry, almost every surface is covered in microorganisms almost all the time. Swab a countertop, your skin, or your dinner, and you will find a little world - and that covers only the estimated 1% of bacteria that can be cultured! Obviously, trying to sterilize our patients (and our countertops) is futile; we have to try to target the bad organisms and let the rest happily crawl all over us - they greatly outnumber our own cells in our bodies anyway.\nIn the microbial world, bacteria lie toward the “less like us” end of the spectrum (Figure 1.1). They are prokaryotes, not eukaryotes like fungi, protozoa, and humans. Viruses are even more different from us - they are a virus-making package of genetic instructions in a cellattacking protein coat (Figure 1.2). Differences between cells of microorganisms and humans in anatomy, biochemistry, and affinity of antibiotics for their targets are what allow for the safe and effective use of antibiotics. In this section we will concentrate on the microbiology of bacteria. The unique characteristics of fungi, viruses, mycobacteria, and parasites will be discussed in the sections where agents active against those organisms are introduced.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The Microbial World\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Relative Sizes of Microorganisms\n\n\nDifferentiating bacteria that are responsible for infection from those just along for the ride can be difficult. Many bacteria that can cause human disease are also normal commensal flora, including Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, growth of one of these organisms from a culture is not necessarily synonymous with infection. Suspicion of infection is increased greatly if the organism grows from a normally sterile site, such as the bloodstream or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Indicators of infection in nonsterile sites (such as sputum and wound cultures) are a high number of organisms, the presence of inflammatory cells, and symptoms referable to the culture site (e.g., cough or dyspnea in a patient with a sputum culture growing S pneumoniae, redness and pain in a patient with a skin culture growing S aureus).\nDefinitive identification and susceptibility testing may take anywhere from hours to months, depending on the organism and the methods used. Microscopic examination and staining may allow for rapid preliminary identification. For bacteria, the most important of these techniques is the Gram stain. Being able to interpret preliminary results of microbiology testing will allow you to provide the most appropriate therapy for your patients as early as possible. Increasingly, new tools such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or matrix-associated laser desorptionionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry are being used to provide even more rapid and precise organism identification, but these methods are not available in all settings or on all specimen types.\nOne of the most fundamental differences among types of bacteria is how they react to a Gram stain. Gram stain (crystal violet) is a substance that selectively stains the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria but is easily washed away from gram-negative bacteria. Why? In grampositive bacteria, the outermost membrane is a thick layer of peptidoglycan, a cellular substance that gives bacterial cells rigidity. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane of lipopolysaccharide that blocks the stain from adhering to the peptidoglycan within the cell (Figure 1.3).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Cell Walls of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Organisms\n\n\nGram-negatives also contain peptidoglycan, but in smaller amounts, and it is not the outermost layer of the cell. Both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms contain an inner cell membrane that separates the cell wall from the cytoplasm of the organism. Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5 show how you can identify different bacteria by differences in morphology, oxygen tolerance, and biochemical identification.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Gram Positive Bacteria\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Gram Negative Bacteria\n\n\nRapid identification of gram-positive bacteria based on morphology and preliminary biochemical tests can help to direct therapy.\n\nMorphology: Most medically important gram-positive pathogens are cocci (spheres) rather than bacilli (rods). The finding of gram-positive bacilli should be interpreted within the clinical context: In blood cultures, gram-positive bacilli often represent common skin contaminants (such as Cutibacterium, Corynebacterium, and Bacillus species), since the skin barrier must be bypassed to collect the culture. Detection of gram-positive bacilli from necrotizing wound infections suggests clostridial infection, whereas the finding of grampositive bacilli in CSF cultures raises the concern for Listeria.\nColony clustering: Within the gram-positive cocci, the staphylococci tend to form clusters, whereas the streptococci and enterococci appear in pairs or chains. Again, the clinical context aids in interpretation: The finding of streptococci in a respiratory culture suggests S pneumoniae, whereas a report of streptococci from an intra-abdominal culture suggests Enterococcus (which may be identified preliminarily as a Streptococcus).\nBiochemistry and appearance on agar: The rapid catalase test helps to differentiate staphylococci from streptococci. The coagulase test is useful for differentiating the more virulent (coagulase-positive) S aureus from its cousin the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis. S epidermidis is a frequent contaminant of blood cultures; if only one of a pair of blood samples is positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci, treatment may not be required. The pattern of hemolysis (clearing around colonies on agar plates) helps to differentiate among the streptococci: the oral flora (α-hemolytic S pneumoniae and the viridans streptococci); pathogens of the skin, pharynx, and genitourinary tract (β-hemolytic group A and B strep); and the bugs of gastrointestinal origin (nonhemolytic enterococci: the more common Enterococcus faecalis and the more resistant Enterococcus faecium).\n\nPreliminary identification is somewhat less useful with the gram-negative bacteria because more extensive biochemical tests are usually needed to differentiate among them.\n\nMorphology: Among gram-negative pathogens, the bacilli predominate. The situation in which identification of gram-negative cocci is most useful is in the setting of meningitis, where this finding would strongly suggest Neisseria meningitidis. Note also that some organisms have an intermediate or “coccobacillary” appearance, which may suggest organisms of the genera Haemophilus, Moraxella, or Acinetobacter.\nGlucose/lactose fermentation: Many pathogens within the order Enterobacterales (including E coli, Klebsiella, Serratia, and Enterobacter) generally ferment glucose/lactose; at this point the lab may identify them as “enteric gram-negative rods” or “lactosefermenting gram-negative rods.” In contrast, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Burkholderia are “nonfermenters”; a report of “nonfermenting gram-negative rods” should lead you to reassess and, if necessary, broaden your antibiotic coverage, because many of these organisms have a high level of antibiotic resistance.\nFastidious organisms: These organisms are picky eaters - they grow slowly and often require specially supplemented media. Thus, it may take a few days to a few weeks for them to grow from culture."
